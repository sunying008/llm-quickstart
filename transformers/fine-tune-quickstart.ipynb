Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\\\\n\\\\nBottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh.\"}"

Ho ho, anyway my sis who happens to live in the area took me here for breakfast since we had nothing to do at the time. I was pretty excited to try this place when my sis told me about it. We came here on a weekday, so good thing there was no wait. \\n\\nThey had this offer on the table where if we checked in on twitter we got a free lemonade, and of course we did. As far as what we ordered, my sis got the corned beef hash plate, while I got the roasted chicken hash plate. We also split a brown sugar banana flapjack. \\n\\nThe service was pretty decent. Our waiter was able to refill our drinks when the time was right, checked in to make sure we were ok, and bring out our food in a reasonable amount of time. Well, since it wasn't busy, it should have been that way. \\n\\nI got to sample my sister's and her's was pretty good. The corned beef was cooked properly and I remember it came in shredded pieces. Much easier to handle. Unfortunately I felt my roasted chicken hash was a little too dry. White/breast meat is ok to me, its just that the chicken wasn't how i hoped it would taste. Like its been cooked for a little too long. The sides and fixins were decent, and I was not able to finish my meal because the portions were so damn big. Hats off to Hash House. \\n\\nAs for the flapjack itself, I can eat that thing all day. It comes on this huge plate and it practically covers the entire surface. You can see the bits of banana glisten in the light and the generous amount of butter waiting for you to spread it all over the flapjack. Each and every bite was sweet. the kind that makes your jaw tingle in the right way kind of sweet. I'd give 5 stars on this thing alone if I could. As much of a carnivore as I am, I'd rather just have this when I'm there. \\n\\nI'll be in Vegas twice next month. You know where to find me and what I'll be eating.</td>\n",

All they had was vegan vanilla &amp; vegan peanut butter cookie. I was REALLY REALLY craving the peanut butter chocolate chip vegan shake I had at the other location. \\n\\nSo, then we move on to the regular flavors. They were out of cookies &amp; cream and only had \\\"asian\\\" flavors\\\" + vanilla &amp; cookie dough. My husband &amp; I were sharing since the shakes are so large, but we couldn't agree on a flavor because he doesn't like \\\"asian\\\" flavors. He turned me down when I suggested lychee, black sesame, and red bean. Durian was certainly out of the question, and green tea was out of stock... We ended up settling on a milk tea &amp; a jasmine green tea milk tea with almond milk for me. Since I was with my vegan friend, I asked to see if the jasmine milk tea would be vegan, since I suggest almond milk, but when he showed us the bag, it had some weird milk protein that she couldn't have in the green tea. Bummer. \\n\\nThe guy was very nice, although the girl working seemed SO clueless on how to make anything. She had to ask him everything, like \\\"do we have this flavor\\\" when she could have walked over and checked... He said because they just opened, they will be getting in more flavors soon and knew that they were limited. I'd say not very kid friendly as they only have high bar stools &amp; 2 tables with high bar stools (1 which had employee stuff strewn about).... \\n\\nOverall, I have 1 more groupon left to spend at this place. I will come back in a couple of weeks. Hopefully they will have received more flavors by then.</td>\n",

Wasn't even an option for us.  Was there a logical reason?  No.  We would have liked to do so, but c'est la vie.\\n\\nWe ended up doing regular restaurant/kitchen dining, partially as a grave miscommunication between us and the server.\\n\\nWe ordered their \\\"Grand Ichi Ban\\\" sushi plate and yakisoba to share between two adults and a child.  This included a variety of side dishes, as well as California rolls and an assortment of nigiri.\\n\\nThe appetizers (miso soup and cucumber/bean sprout salad) were delicious and well timed, although I really could have done without the mushrooms in the miso soup.  \\n\\nTheir yakisoba included a rather bland \\\"teriyaki\\\" sauce that I felt relied too heavily on salt, as well as having the inclusion of mushrooms (which I have never seen in yakisoba ANYWHERE else, and personally is disgusting to me).  The California rolls were unremarkable, and it seemed as if the avocado wasn't exactly \\\"freshed sliced\\\", even though equivalent rolls in the pacific northwest ARE, even when avocado is out of season (surprising given Arizona's proximity to the crop).  While most of the nigiri was tasty and of quality presentation, the baffling choice of Imitation Krab for one roll (and an oddly cut, overly long, blocky piece at that) was very baffling.\\n\\nNot having a lot of experience with sushi in the desert southwest, I'm not quite sure wha the standards are, but by my standards, it falls short... and for far too much money for the product.\\n\\nAlso, the waiter took far too long at the end to present the check.  I had to actually request it in a fit of desperation as my preschooler had lost his attention span and was causing a disruption.

I will admit, though, the hippie school bus and the mushrooms on springs are a fun novelty that keep me entertained.\\n\\nBut kitschy-ness aside, the food is pretty darn good. The pizza crusts are chewy without being rubbery, not too thick and not too thin. The topping combinations are certainly interesting - not anything I would have thought to put together on a pizza.  But they work.  I tend to go for the Philosopher's Pie, which features steak, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, olives, mozzarella and feta on an olive oil and garlic sauce. I recently tried one of their sandwiches, too, which make for great lunch fare. Added bonus: Mellow Mushroom can easily appease the vegetarian/vegan diners as well as providing gluten free options (expect a wait for gluten free, though: they take it pretty seriously and clean the kitchen before making gluten free dough to ensure it's safe and truly gluten free).\\n\\nAnd the beer list is well developed for a chain, too. Yeah, Bud-Miller-Coors products are there for the unadventurous, but the craft selection is enough to keep most beer fans happy. You get the usual suspects (Bell's, Dogfish Head, Smuttynose, etc) as well as a great selection of local brews too. If it's in, be sure to grab a glass of Catawba Valley Brewing's White Zombie.\\n\\nBe warned: they are a bit pricey. All said, it's a fun place to gather with friends for pizza and beer.</td>\n",

The trip was planned for months and being from Pittsburgh myself I wanted them to experience Mt Washington and the incredible view as well as what I believed would be one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. We were a party of 5 and made our reservation for Saturday night September 21st at 9pm in order to not be in the busiest time period. We arrived at 5 minutes to 9 and were rudely treated at first by the valet parking attendant as the entry to the valet parking area is actually very tight and very confusing. He literally shouted at us to \\\"back up\\\" and in general just made us feel like school kids!!.....well up in the elevator to the restaurant itself and indeed the views are spectacular....unfortunately that was the last \\\"spectacular\\\" item of the evening. After checking in at the host stand it took another 15 minutes before out table was ready??....and it was NOT busy at this stage and as above one of the reasons we made the later booking. After being seated it was at least another 10 minutes before anyone came to attend to us other than getting served ice water???....the waitress finally came to the table and gave us the menus and told us of the specials....took our cocktail orders and was off.....another 10 minutes passed and finally we were served 1 small bread basket with one small dish of butter....for 5 people??....still no cocktails but we placed an appetizer order and also our entree order as well as we were really hungry at this point.....well another 10 minutes passed and still no cocktails or appetizers.....we had devoured the small bread basket long ago so we asked another different waiter if we could get another basket and it seemed like we were asking for something way out of line???.....finally our waitress came back to our table (after we observed her across the room at another table chatting for at least 10 minutes) and asked about our cocktails which by now had been ordered about 20 minutes ago.....5 minutes later the cocktails arrived and 5 minutes after that the appetizers arrived....had oysters rockefeller which were cold and just very bland in general. Approximately another 15 minutes later our entrees arrived and as 3 in our group had ordered steaks we found that all 3 were NOT at anywhere near the requested level of temperature other than the one filet that had been requested as medium well and since it was butterflied it had been cooked to a piece of shoe leather!!!....the other 2 were to be medium and were basically what anyone would call very rare to rare at best....with the length of time it had taken just to get served we were not about to try and send anything back....the one Chilean Sea Bass entree was very good....the salmon entree was again cold, bland and just not what one would expect from a establishment with the reputation the Monterey Bay Fish Grotto was supposed to have....oh and the $12 tricolor roasted potatoes were also cold, bland and tasteless!!.....we ate what we could and left after a $400 bill with significant disappointment!!.....I know some will say why did you go to the \\\"Fish Grotto\\\" and order steaks but thats what our group chose and if it is on the menu and at the prices charged they also should be nothing short of excellent which they were NOT....having dined all over the Pittsburgh area for the last 35 years I can assure diners who are looking for a great dining experience that there are FAR BETTER choices than the MBFG.....unless you want to spend $80 per person (with NO wine) just for the chance of having a table with the great view I highly suggest you look elsewhere even on Mt Washington....as per the title simply not even close to \\\"The Standard\\\" expected and deserved.</td>\n",
